# Weather
A **very** simple CLI weather app in Go.

## Usage
Simply run `weather` from your terminal. Weather will guesstimate your location via IP geolocation and fetch the weather from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com).

## Future Enhancements
- ~~switch weather source to Open-Meteo.~~
- Return additional weather properties.
- Add the ability to specify a location by city name.
- Return a struct object rather than a series of properties.
- TUI
