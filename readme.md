# Weather
A **very** simple CLI weather app in Go.

## Usage
Simply run `weather` from your terminal. Weather will guesstimate your location via IP geolocation and fetch the weather from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org).

## Future Enhancements
- Switch weather source to Open-Meteo.
- Return additional weather properties.
- Add the ability to specify a location by city name.
